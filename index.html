                                University majoring in computer science. I’m a non-traditional student whose interest in
                                computers and programming was piqued later in life than your average CS major.

                                area.
                                Though the two fields are worlds apart I value the time spent in my former field and
                                have
                                found

                                both time and stress have proven to be great assets as I’ve transitioned into the tech
