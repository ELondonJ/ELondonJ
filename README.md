# Personal Website
##### Author: London Joseph

This web page is the final project for the CS410 Intro to Web Developement at
Portland State University.  The site utilizes a single-page layout with a navigation
bar at the top and about, resume, project and contact sections. 

The site is built using CSS, HTML, Boostrap and JavaScript.  

##### Navbar
The navigation bar is built Boostrap classes and the Boostrap JavaScript bundle were used 
for the navbar. The navbar also uses the google font [Modak](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Modak?thickness=10)
for the logo.
##### Animation
On large and medium screen an interactive partical animation is displayed.  I followed
a tutorial by [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGioNBHrFU4) for the animation.
##### About
The about section has a short bio and picture of myself. This section uses a combination of custom CSS and
Boostrap for formatting and design.
