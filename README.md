# Personal Website
#### Author: London Joseph

This web page is the final project for the CS410 Intro to Web Developement at
Portland State University.  The site utilizes a single-page layout with a navigation
bar at the top and about, resume, project and contact sections. 

The site is built using CSS, HTML, Boostrap and JavaScript.  

### Navbar
The navigation bar is built Boostrap classes and the Boostrap JavaScript bundle were used 
for the navbar. 
### Animation
On large and medium screen an interactive partical animation is displayed.  I followed
a tutorial by [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGioNBHrFU4) for the animation.
