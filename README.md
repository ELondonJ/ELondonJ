This web page is the final project for the CS410 Intro to Web Developement at
Portland State University.  The site utilizes a single-page layout with a navigation
bar at the top and about, resume, project and contact sections. 

The site is built using CSS, HTML, Boostrap and JavaScript.  

#### Navbar
The navigation bar is built Boostrap classes and the Boostrap JavaScript bundle were used 
for the navbar. The navbar also uses the google font [Modak](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Modak?thickness=10)
for the logo.
#### Animation

a tutorial by [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGioNBHrFU4) for the animation. The code for the animation is found in anima.js
